# C Learning Playground 🎉

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I collect all the code I've written while learning C! 👨‍💻

This repo is my personal coding playground—a place to organize, revisit, and improve the code snippets, programs, and mini-projects I create during my C programming journey. 🚀

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📝 Practice coding in C and document my progress.
- 📂 Keep all my experiments in one place for easy reference.
- 📈 Track my growth in programming skills.
- 🤝 Share my learning journey and examples with others.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

You will find code related to various topics such as:

- 💻 Basic syntax and programs (Hello World, variables, input/output).
- 🔄 Control structures (if-else, loops, switch).
- 🛠️ Mini-projects and practice problems.

## ⚠️ Notes

- All code is written for practice and learning. Mistakes are part of the process.
- Feel free to fork, use, or suggest improvements.

## 🤝 Contributions

If you are learning C too, you’re welcome to open issues or pull requests with your suggestions, fixes, or code examples.

Happy coding! 🎉
